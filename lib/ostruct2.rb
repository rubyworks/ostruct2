# OpenStruct2 is a better OpenStruct class.
#
# To demonstrate the weakness of the original OpenStruct, try this IRB session:
#
#   irb(main):001:0> o = OpenStruct.new
#   => #<OpenStruct>
#   irb(main):002:0> o.display = "Hello, World!"
#   => "Hello, World!"
#   irb(main):003:0> o.display
#   #<OpenStruct display="Hello, World!">=> nil
#
# This new OpenStruct class allows *almost* any member name to be used.
# The only exceptions are methods starting with double underscores,
# such as `__id__` and `__send__`, and a few neccessary public
# methods: `clone`, `dup`, `freeze`, `hash`, `to_enum`, `to_h`,
# `to_s` and `inspect`, as well as `instance_eval` and `instance_exec`.
#
# Also note that `empty`, `eql`, `equal`, `frozen` and `key` can be used as
# members but the key-check shorthand of using `?`-methods cannot be used since
# these have special definitions.
#
# To offset the loss of most methods, OpenStruct provides numerous
# bang-methods which can be used to manipulate the data, e.g. `#each!`.
# Currently most bang-methods route directly to the underlying hash table,
# so developers should keep that in mind when using this feature. A future
# version may add an intermediate interface to always ensure proper "CRUD",
# functonality but in the vast majority of cases it will make no difference,
# so it is left for later consideration.
#
# This improved version of OpenStruct also has no issues with being cloned
# since it does not depend on singleton methods to work. But singleton methods
# are used to help boost performance. But instead of always creating singleton
# methods, it only creates them on the first attempt to use them.
